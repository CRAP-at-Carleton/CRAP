## Contributing

Please feel free to contribute! The whole point of this project is to give students have control over their course registration software, and empower them to create features they want to see. [Here is an introduction to creating a fork and pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).

## Alternative Name

As this software is intended to replace [ENROLL](https://apps.carleton.edu/campus/registrar/schedule/enroll/), and alternative project name might be EIM (Enroll IMproved). :smile:
